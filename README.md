# QGIS Jupyter Notebooks

This project is still in very early stages. As it currently stands, it only works with Windows installations created by the OSGeo4W installer (and probably not even all of those). It also requires Jupyter to be already installed in the QGIS environment, manually, which itself requires pip to be installed.

That said, what the plugin *does* do: launch Jupyter in the current project's directory, with the QGIS Python environment loaded. This alone is a big step.
